BLIT is short for **B**anner**L**ord **I**mage **T**ool. It is a tool for processing the modding images of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord.

> I'm glad about the coincidence that the app's name is the same as the function `blit()` *(for copying pixels from one image to another in graphics programming)*, which does imply it has something to do with images. 😁

This app is still under development and will provide more features. Should you want to report a bug or request for a feature, please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/0x1c-works/BLIT/issues).
