BLIT is short for **B**anner**L**ord **I**mage **T**ool. It is a tool for processing the modding images of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord.

This app is still under development and will provide more features. Should you want to report a bug or request for a feature, please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/0x1c-works/BLIT/issues).

> **Fun fact:** <br />
> I didn't realise after a while that the app's name also happens to be the same as the famous function `blit()`, which is used in graphics programming to copy pixels from one render buffer to another. <br />
> So, it absolutely have something to do with images!
