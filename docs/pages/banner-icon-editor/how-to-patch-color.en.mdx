# How To Support Custom Colors

<Callout>
This article contains a lot of technical details. If you're not a coder, you can safely ignore this article.

## Why can't I use custom colors?

In the native game, there is a class called `BannerManager` for managing the
banner data. A method called `GetColorId` within is used for finding a
color's ID by its hex value from a *Dictionary* called `ColorPalette`, which
contains all the registered colors from all `banner_icons.xml` files loaded into
the game.

The method is implemented something like this:

```csharp
public int GetColorId(uint color)
{
    for(int i = 0; i < BannerManager.ColorPalette.Count - 1; i++){
        if(BannerManager.ColorPalette[i].Value.Color == color){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

As you can see, it treats `ColorPalette` like an array and iterates through by
index, whereas it is actually a *dictionary* and should be accessed by its key
, which is not necessarily a series of 0-based continous integers.

When you tries to import the custom banner colors of your mod, the color IDs will
very likely not fit into the "valid" range of 0 to `Count - 1`. The code above will
then throw an exception for retrieving a value from the dictionary with a bad
key.

## How to patch?

<Callout type="warning">
Patching the code may cause conflicts with other mods, so do it with caution.
You should also keep an eye on the future releases of Bannerlord, in case
TaleWorlds fixes the bug.
</Callout>

You'll need to patch it with **Harmony**. The following code snippet is an
example of how to do it:

```csharp
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(BannerManager), nameof(BannerManager.GetColorId))]
[HarmonyPriority(Priority.First)]
internal class FixGetColorId
{
    private static bool Prefix(ref int __result, uint color)
    {
        foreach (KeyValuePair<int, BannerColor> colorEntry in BannerManager.ColorPalette)
        {
            if (colorEntry.Value.Color == color)
            {
                __result = colorEntry.Key;
                break;
            }
        }
        __result = -1;
        return false;
    }
}
```
